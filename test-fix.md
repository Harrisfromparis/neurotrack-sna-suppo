# Error Fixes Applied

## React Context Error Fixes

### 1. Fixed Sonner Component
- **Issue**: The Sonner toaster component was importing and using `useTheme` from `next-themes` package
- **Fix**: Removed the `next-themes` dependency and hardcoded theme to "light"
- **Location**: `/src/components/ui/sonner.tsx`

### 2. Fixed Component State Initialization
- **Issue**: Several components were initializing state with props directly, causing stale closure issues
- **Fixes**:
  - `CrisisManagement`: Changed initial `studentId` from `selectedStudentId` to empty string
  - `CommunicationHub`: Changed initial `studentId` from `selectedStudentId` to empty string  
  - `BehaviorTracking`: Changed initial `studentId` from `selectedStudentId` to empty string
- **Added**: useEffect hooks to properly sync form state when selectedStudentId changes

### 3. Enhanced Form Synchronization
- **Added**: useEffect hooks in all form components to properly handle student selection changes
- **Ensured**: Functional updates are used for all useKV setters to avoid stale closures

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `/src/components/ui/sonner.tsx` - Removed next-themes dependency
2. `/src/components/crisis/CrisisManagement.tsx` - Fixed state initialization and sync
3. `/src/components/communication/CommunicationHub.tsx` - Fixed state initialization and sync
4. `/src/components/behavior/BehaviorTracking.tsx` - Fixed state initialization and sync

### The primary error was caused by:
The Sonner component trying to use React context from `next-themes` which isn't available in this Vite-based environment, causing the "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')" error.

All fixes maintain functionality while ensuring proper React patterns and avoiding context-related issues.
